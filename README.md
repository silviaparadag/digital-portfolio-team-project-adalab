# "Programadoras Junior" An Adalabers portfolio platform

## Summary

In the third module of the course we have to make a web page to create a digital portfolio projects for Adalabers developers to presenting their best projects.

On the website, you will be able to complete the information form about the author and the project, uploading project and user image. Once the data form has been completed, users will be able to share the project detail by an URL, so the community will have access to the projects created by all Adalabers.

The website, according to the client's request that our Product Owner told us, is composed of two pages, both interactive and with a responsive design that starts with a mobile first design.

## How it works

The objectives were create a **Landing page** that briefly presents the web, and from which there is a button to access to the **form page**, from which you can upload your projects.

The three parts of the form page are as follows:

- Data Form, with all required fields, such as Project Name, Demo Link, Repo Link, User Name, etc.
- Preview section, to preview in advance the final look and feel.
- Hero, with a functionality to access all the uploaded projects. For now, as there are no projects uploaded, a warning message has been left, until the backend development team allows to save them all.
With the creation of a digital project file, which as mentioned before, can be shared with a link created with the information filled in.

In addition, if the user can finish completing the form later, the data is saved in the Local Storage, so that she can continue with the fields already filled in.

> **Note** In this project, we can find the following files and folders:
>
>- The folder 📂 `src/` is the files of this web page: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and images.
>- The folders 📚 `public/` and `docs/`, are generated automatically when we start the project. GULP reads the files found in the src/ folder, processes them and then generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.
>- Other 📝 files found in the repository root as 'gulpfile.js', 'package.json', etc. are configuration files and we don't need to modify them.
>- To publish on GitHub Pages and generate your page for production run the command: `npm run githubpages`
